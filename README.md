# Hiro's Quick Links

### A Chrome browser extension

#### Features

* Populates a panel with handy WooCommerce navigation links
* Toggle WordPress notices (for screenshots, etc)
* Automatically hides any Yoast SEO columns added in the products page

#### Usage notes:

When first signing in to a WooCommerce site, the links will take a few seconds to several seconds to load (be patient). After the links have been loaded once, they are retained for the life of the browser session.
